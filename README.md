## Available Formulae

### ðŸŽ¼ Maestro

A CLI tool that "conducts" Git Worktrees like an orchestra and turbo-charges parallel development with Claude Code.

- **Orchestrate Git Worktrees**: Manage multiple branches as independent "orchestra members"
- **Claude Code Integration**: AI-powered diff reviews and code suggestions via MCP
- **GitHub Integration**: Create worktrees directly from Issues/PRs
- **tmux/fzf Support**: Lightning-fast switching between worktrees

For more details, see the [Maestro repository](https://github.com/camoneart/maestro).

```bash
brew install camoneart/tap/maestro
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter installation issues:

1. **Update Homebrew**: `brew update`
2. **Check for conflicts**: `brew doctor`
3. **Force relink**: `brew link --overwrite maestro`
